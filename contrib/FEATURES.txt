Why I did it ?
==============

I wanted to build my own aircraft for fun and with freedom.
Fun to BUILD an fun to FLY.

Build has interresting aspects for me :

- architecture,
- reusability and comprehensiveness,
- scripting,
- 3d modelling,
- texturing, painting,
- animating

I want to test other frameworks (organisation of files, modularity, property tree) than commonly used.

Fly consists of technical and agility challenges :

- mastering instruments
- mastering radio-navigation
- smooth landings even if there are turbulences
- keeping flight level, speed and bearing

And explore earth, big international airports, very short runways on little islands or altiports.
So the first release of this aircraft, according to me, had to permit theese things.


My goals
========

This aircraft is NOT a rafale, I just modeled an aircraft as beautiful as it is.
I did not create a REAL aircraft but I tried to make a REALISTIC aircraft.

I like piloting, I like speed, I like pretty aircrafts !
So the primary goals are :

- a good looking aircraft
- an aircraft which one it's possible to radio-navigate
- enough instruments to be able to fly
- enjoying to fly with, to land with
- animations : gears, wingtips, strobe, commands, afterburner


Expected for the futur releases

- --rembrandt/als-- hdr
- improve yasim
- add more instruments : gps, radar
- more playable (tooltips, tutorials)
- add other sound
- best effects of textures


Hopes ;)
========

Building

- lean : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing
- improve FPS
- respect best practices
- become a template aircraft to help beginners to create their aircraft
- become a test aircraft to test reusability of instruments, to test MVC-like architecture

Flying

- become a frequent used aircraft
